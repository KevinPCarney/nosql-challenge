This exercise was about the interaction between jupyter notebook and mongoDB.  A JSON containing data points for 38K restaurants.  After importing the JSON into the requisite database, I generated a new entry which was added into the database.  Afterwards I modified the data types of a number of fields.  From here I began to conduct analysis based on different inquiries and converted the inquiries into dataframes.
